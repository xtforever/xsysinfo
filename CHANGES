Changes from version 1.6 to 1.7:
o  Added full SMP support as follows:

o  the follow data and/or functions were modified to support a SMP
   kernel in sysinfo.h
   char *cpu field added to load struct		// modified
   extern int get_total_procs( void );		// added

o  the follow data and/or functions were modified to support a SMP
   kernel in sysinfo.c
   void get_load(struct load * result)		// modified
   int get_total_procs( void );			// added

o  the follow data and/or functions were modified to support a SMP 
   kernel in xsysinfo.c
   struct AppData, *AppDataPtr			// modified
   static XtResource application_resources[]	// modified
   static XrmOptionDescRec options[]		// modified
   static void getloadCB( widget, client_data, call_data ) // modified
   static void create_app( top )		// modified

o  Added a define to allow turning off of the now default SMP mode.
   Turning off SMP mode on a SMP enabled kernel will display the
   the average of all the cpu's load which is still contained on
   on the first line of /proc/stat

Changes from version 1.5 to 1.6:

o  Added a define to allow specifying the update time in milli-seconds. This
   is currently the default. To change the behaviour edit the Imakefile and
   XSysinfo.ad, call `imake', `make clean' and `make'.
   This change was contributed by Thomas M. Ott <Labalutsch@aol.com>. 

o  Added support for /proc/swaps in newer (2.1.24) kernels. This pseudo file
   gives information about every swapfile used by the system.
   This change was contributed by Florian Depke <depke@cs.tu-berlin.de>.

o  Fixed a cosmetical bug which leaves space between the right end of the bar
   and the right end of the gauge if the bar should have the same width as the
   gauge.

o  There was a bug which cause a segmentation fault after starting xsysinfo
   if compiled without optimization. This is now fixed.

o  minor changes to the X resources

o  The changes in xsysinfo are now explained in a separate CHANGES file.

o  Added "Maintained-by:" to the LSM file.

   Ronald Wahl <Ronald.Wahl@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>

Changes from version 1.4 to 1.5:

o  The mem-bar now consist of two segments only: used memory and cache/buffers.
o  Rename the load to loadavg.
o  Replaced the idle bar with a load bar consisting of three segments:
   user load/system load/nice load
o  Added a define to allow empty segments to disappear (currently the default).
   Otherwise every segment will be at least 1 pixel wide. To change the
   behaviour edit the Imakefile, call `imake', `make clean' and `make'.
o  Changed color of some bars.

Changes from version 1.3 to 1.4:

o  Fixed mem-bar that was broken in 1.3. Removed 4th segment again and
   merged buffers & cached.
o  Added -nolabels switch for use with fvwm's GoodStuff (thanks to Ronald
   Wahl <rwa@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de> for patches)

   Martin Buck   <martin-2.buck@student.uni-ulm.de>


Changes from version 1.2 to 1.3:

o  Made xsysinfo understand new /proc/meminfo format introduced in 1.3.x
   kernels.

o  Split mem-bar into 4 segments (data, shared, buffers, cached) if info
   is available.

Changes from version 1.1 to 1.2:

o	load value

   The gauge for CPU load is now capable to display values up to 8.0. The 
   bar is automatically subdivided in segments when necessary (see. below). 


o	proc filesystem

   The proc filesystem under kernel 0.99pl5 reports the absolute CPU idle
   time in file /proc/uptime and not like the earlier kernels, with my patches
   applied, in file /proc/idle. I changed xsysinfo to obtain the idle value 
   from uptime.


o	swap display

   The 0.99pl5 kernel doesn't support a detailed swap space reporting in
   /proc/meminfo any longer. Only the total swap space statistics can be 
   obtained, so the swap gauge of xsysinfo is not segmented as in version 1.1.


o	color resources

   There is a separate resource file for color displays, which is loaded
   automatically by X's customizations mechanism (see below).


Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1:

o	proc filesystem

   I have completely rewritten the code to get the kernel params. It now uses
   the proc filesystem, which made the whole stuff a lot easier. Another
   advantage of the proc fs is, that xsysinfo can run under normal permissions
   and need not to be recompiled with every new kernel release. 


o	memory display changed

   The two gauges for memory and cache sizes are now merged together. The
   new gauge is still in form of a bar, but is subdivided into three `segments',
   each displayed in a different color. The meaning of the three segments
   is: buffer cache, shared part of memory, non-shared part of memory. The 
   length of the whole bar is proportional to the amount of all used memory.


o	more than one swap area supported

   The gauge for swap size is now also subdivided, one `segment' for each
   swap file/partition.


o	gauges now can be disabled

   Now it is possible to disable each of the gauges either through 
   application resources or through command line options.
